Add OptionPattern to bad symbols

Handle FormatIssues that may come from abstracting

Update BlankPredicate scan with whitelisted symbols

Add rule catching implicit Times in Set:
```
a = 1; b = 2 c = 3;
```

forgotten `;` leads to parsing as `(2 c) = 3`

Add `"Editor"` option to CodeInspect

Add a note about handling Q-functions that take more than 1 arg

It is unclear what to do with them. If `_FreeQ` appears, it may still be incorrect code, but the correct code is not `_?FreeQ`

Add experimental support for disabled regions comment syntax

Example:
```
(* ::CodeInspect::Push:: \*)
(* ::CodeInspect::Disable::DuplicateClausesIf:: \*)

(* ::CodeInspect::Pop:: \*)
```

Add a higher confidence to Times appearing in variable declarations (probably a missing comma)

add `"InheritedProperties"` option to allow CellIndex to be passed down

Use InheritedProperties to allow suppressed regions to work at top-level in notebooks

Included in Mathematica 12.2

Fix symbols in wrong context


## 1.1 - 30 Sep, 2020

### Scans and suggestions

Scan for UnSameQ, which is very similar to System\`UnsameQ

Catch the case of `x_List` binding arguments that are intended for `OptionsPattern[]`
```
CodeInspectSummarize[
"f[x_List : {}, OptionsPattern[]] := x"
]
```

Allow code like this to pass:
```
SyntaxInformation[f] = {"ArgumentsPattern" -> {\_., OptionsPattern[]}}
```

scan for StringMatch

Add scan for 3 (or more) args to MessageName

Add BackwardsCompaibility issues and tests for bug 390755 changes

Duplicate keys in list of rules in Graph is ok

Suggest inserting `*` with implicit Times across lines


### API changes

Display other implicit tokens, such as implicit 1, implicit All, and implicit Null

Add `"TabWidth"` option to CodeInspectSummarize.

This will format tabs in the display correctly. The previous behavior simply formatted tabs as a single space.

Add `"TabWidth"` option to CodeInspect to be passed through to CodeConcreteParse.

Also remove `"LineNumberExclusions"` and `"LineHashExclusions"` options form CodeInspectSummarize. These were not used very much and were interefering with tab work.

Add a definition for ScriptForm format

Add BracketMismatches functionality.

This is similar to the Implicit Tokens functionality. These functions will identify and display cases of mismatched brackets.

Allow lints themselves to be summarized

Since we have an explicit lint that we want to summarize, then make sure that `"TagExclusions"` and ConfidenceLevel do not interfere with summarizing

Add environ lines, which are lines above and below lints that provide more context

Put in some work to only report first token of potentially large expressions

Rename some tags

Allow opening files in external editor with only a file name, or only file name and line number

Only report the opener of a GroupMissingOpener

The contents can be arbitrarily complex

Handle the new UnterminatedGroupNode

When filtering lints, sort by severity, then sort by Source

add proper InspectedBytesObject

In non-interactive cases, take CodeActions and print their suggestions

Add implicit tokens for ExpectedOperands


### Performance improvements

Use ReadByteArray instead of Import, for speed

Disable shadow filtering for now

The filtering takes quadratic time


### Error handling

Tighten up error reporting when given bad input


### Fixes

Fix implicit tokens in `a\[ThinSpace]b`

Fix errors when linting code such as `Module[{a@}, b]`

Fix spaces in messages


### Miscellaneous

A massive number of minor bug fixes, typos fixes, and reorganizations, tweaks and cleanup


## 1.0 - 24 Mar, 2020

Add more cases for warning about implicit Times

handle `BeginStaticAnalysisIgnore[]` / `EndStaticAnalysisIgnore[]` ending with `;`

Rename Lint -> CodeInspector

Add scan for using Rule here `a_ -> a+1` instead of RuleDelayed

Show a `^` for the first character of each AdditionalSource

Add rule scanning for `ImageSize -> ImageDimensions[]`

Add a basic scan for `arg_ :> arg_`

Add a check suggested by Szabolcs:
warn about optional argument here: `foo[a_, b_:Automatic, OptionsPattern[]]`

calling `foo[1, "Bar" -> 2]` makes `"Bar" -> 2` get bound to b, and not to `OptionsPattern[]`

Put a limit on number of implicit Times x returned


## 0.15.1 - 23 Jan, 2020
